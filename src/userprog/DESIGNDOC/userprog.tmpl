			   ARGUMENT PASSING
			   ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

- from the start_process I tokenize the command line into arguments using
simple technique loop until a space is found then start another argv.

- then in setup_stack() I loop over them as the x86 calling convention states.
putting the argument values first and then storing their addresses, after that
I save the address of the first address (address of argv) then I put argc. 
then a fake return address as main doesn't really return.
if the stack overflows, it will make a page fault which I considered handled.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

char * strtok_r (char *s, const char *delimiters, char **save_ptr)  
this function makes keeping track of the tokenizer position, unlike
normal strtok which keeps track of the tokenizer, the problem of the 
normal strtok is it will use stack pointer to keep track of the string
which will cause race condition, also it will misbehave if multiple delimiters
occurs consecutively. 

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

I think unix is better because it will make all the pointer dereferencing and
allocating to a normal user program "shell" which safer and more robust.
also adding more features like PATH variables and shell commands will make 
kernel much more complex and bigger which is not good.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>>	added to thread.c
	/*lock used to allocate fd*/
	static struct lock fd_lock;

	this variable is used to make allocation of fd for different opened files.
	concurrent and race-cycle free. in every assignment we atomically increase
	the counter for the current thread and return the new counter and
	links the new file to it.

>>	added to struct thread , thread.h
	/* Owned by userprog/process.c. */
    uint32_t *pagedir;                  /* Page directory. */
    struct list children;               /*children processes*/
    struct thread * parent_thread;      /*pointer to the waiting thread for this process to end*/
    struct condition wait_cond;         /*wait condition for sys_wait */
    struct list opened_files;           /*opened files by this thread*/
    int fd_counter;                     /*file descriptor counter for this thread*/
    struct process_child_elem * child_elem_pntr;  /*holder for status for this thread*/
    struct semaphore wait_sema;

    - children represents the children of the current thread which is used in wait and exec.
    - wait_cond is used in wait and exit process.
    - opened_files is used to keep track of the currently opened files.
    - fd_counter is used to link every file to a unique fd.
    - wait_sema is used to make sure process execute doesn't return until load() is finished.
    - child_elem_pntr is a pointer to the entry of this child process in the parent 
    children table.

>>	added to thread.h
	struct process_child_elem{
	  tid_t pid;              /*child thread pid*/
	  int status;             /*child thread return status*/
	  struct list_elem child_elem;        /*list element to put thread in children list*/
	};

	- this struct represents entry in children list of every thread. when a thread creates another
	the child thread is stored by this data structure. pid represents child thread pid, status is 
	the exit status of the child thread.

>>	added to thread.h
	struct file_descriptor{
	  struct file *     fp;             /*file which this element represent*/
	  int               fd;             /*file descriptor for this element*/
	  struct list_elem  elem;           /*list element to be stored in thread*/
	};

	- this represents every opened file by this process.
	- fp is the file pointer to this file.
	- fd is the file descriptor for this file.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

	- as explained above, the struct file_descriptor associates every file
	pointer with its file_descriptor for this thread.

	- the function get_new_fd(file) creates a file_descriptor for a file
	pointer. the operation is atomic which means that the file descriptor is
	unique for every thread.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.
	- first we check that the stack pointer is valid, which is implied by
	it is bigger that 0x08048000 and also less than PHYS_BASE and we call 
	function from pagedir.c which tells that this pointer represents a pointer
	in virtual address space.

	- then we do the same validation with every pointer in system calls.

>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data

>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about

	- two as the pagedir_get_page is called for every new page and if the
	full page lies in middle of a page this function is called twice.
	the same is done with 2 bytes if they lies in two different pages.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

	- when any process creates a child, function add_process_to_children()
	which in turn allocates a process_child_elem struct and save it in 
	the parent thread with the exit status uninitialized and the pid of
	the child thread. and the child parent is save in the child thread.

	- when process wait is called, the parent thread checks if that this
	thread is a child and if it hasn't called wait on it before. then it waits
	for the child thread to signal it on its wait_cond.

	- when the child approaches process_exit() it signals parent wait_cond. which
	which allows the thread to continue its operation and then remove the child
	thread from its list so that it won't wait it again.

>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address

>> managing these issues.  Give an example.

	- most of the allocated data is allocated after pointer checks, by that 
	we guarantee that no resources are not freed.

	- also we took advantage of the fact that most of the pointers lies in the
	first of the second argument so we made checks on that before any system calls
	are made.

	- for example take sys_write, it first checks the address of the buffer so now
	we are sure that this address is valid and we can access it. then it checks the
	file descriptor to see if it's valid if it's invalid it returns once again
	no resources is allocated until the proper checks is made.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

	- first I don't wait for load to tell me if the file is valid I check it in
	the beginning of the function to avoid unnecessary allocations.

	- the default value for exit status for any thread is -1 so when load 
	fails it calls thread_exit() which then calls process_exit() which finds 
	that the status is still -1 and then prints this status.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

	= P waits for C:
	- before C exit: 
		| when P calls process wait it will still find child's in its 
		| children list so then it will call cond_wait and wait until
		| process C finishes.
	
	- after C exit:
		| when C exits it will save its status in the parent child list.
		| then when the parent waits it it will find that C exited and it
		| will look it in the list and find its status.

	- in those cases after P waits it frees the entry of C in its list and
	frees its linking pointers.

	= P terminates and don't wait C:
	- before C exits:
		| P will remove C entry from the list and then C will find that and will
		| free its entry.

	- after C exits:
		| P will find that C exited and stored its status, then it will free its entry
		| in the list.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?
	- easier to debug and increase readability, also faster to implement.


>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?
	- advantages is maintains a free-of-race implementation also ensures that 
	every file has its unique fd.

	- I don't find ant disadvantages for now.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?
	- I didn't change it, no need to make it more complex just make tid = pid.
	as tid is always unique.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?
	
	- this assignment wasn't too hard to code but hard to understand, many
	concepts are vague and not clear.

	- also the code coupling is too low and cohesion is too high. debugging 
	one issue in your code makes you open 15-10 files at once to get the bug.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
